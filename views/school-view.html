<h2>2024 Participedia School on Transnational Democratic Innovations</h2>

<p>The landscape of transnational public participation is rapidly changing, with new developments, theories, movements, policies, and successes happening all over the globe. The entangled challenges facing us extend beyond national boundaries, and so do their democratic solutions. Now, more than ever, we need to convene on and acquire the skills necessary to participate in and learn from, transnational democratic innovations.</p>

<p>In partnership with Memorial University, the University of Western Cape, McMaster University, the Coady Institute, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Innovation For Policy Foundation, Mission Publiques and a consortium of leading practitioners and scholars, join us for the next Participedia School to learn about these rich tapestries of innovations, and to develop the skills necessary to analyze, co-design, and implement the transnational public participation of the future!</p>

<p>The event will take place in person on June 10-15, 2024 at both Memorial University (St. John’s, Canada) and the University of Western Cape (Cape Town, South Africa) simultaneously, while offering unique virtual two-way programming at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte, Brazil) to maximize accessibility and impact. Using this global decentralized approach, we hope to create a transnational ecosystem of learning that reflects the subject, connecting students and practitioners from around the world with each other and leading experts.</p>

<p>Participants can register to attend either in person location, Newfoundland or Cape Town, or for the live-streamed programming hosted at UFMG, until spots are filled. Limited scholarships are available on a ‘needs basis’ to cover registration, travel, and housing. All food and drink will be provided to attendees.</p>

<p>The CERi-Participedia Summer School (June 4-10, 2023) – organized under the theme “Radical Democracy”, brought together leading experts, researchers and graduate students and community leaders, activists and practitioners for a week of workshops, discussion, dialogue, community events and field trips. We students joined from the social sciences, including political science, political philosophy, media and communications, sociology, cultural studies, anthropology, economics, environment and related disciplines. Together, with the summer school team and invited guests, we explored what it means to radically re-imagine, research and practice democracy in their communities and in everyday life.</p>
