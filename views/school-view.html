<h2>2024 Participedia School on Transnational Democratic Innovations</h2>

<p>The landscape of transnational public participation - the involvement of individuals or groups from multiple countries in political processes, decision-making, design, or advocacy that transcend national borders or issues - is rapidly changing. There are new innovations, theories, movements, policies, and successes happening around the world. The entangled challenges facing us extend beyond national boundaries, and so do their democratic solutions.</p>

<p>These new transnational processes, methods, and tools are seeing uptake, whether through global deliberative mini-publics and transnational deliberative organizational designs, to, digital infrastructures and methods of connected participation, research, engagement, and coalition building. Now, more than ever, we need to convene on, share, hear from those with experience, and acquire the skills to respond to, learn from, identify, research, and design transnational democratic innovations.</p>

<p>In partnership with Memorial University, the University of Western Cape, McMaster University, the Coady Institute, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Innovation for Policy Foundation, Mission Publiques, Democracy International, and a consortium of leading practitioners and scholars, join us for the next Participedia School on Transnational Democratic Innovations!</p>

<p>The event will take place in person on June 10-15, 2024 simultaneously at three decentralized locations: Memorial University (St. John’s, Canada), the University of Western Cape (Cape Town, South Africa), and the Federal University of Minas Gerais (Belo Horizonte, Brazil). The Brazil experience will primarily take place in Spanish/Portuguese, and the three locations will be connected by unique virtual programming with live translation to maximize accessibility and impact. Using this globally decentralized approach, we hope to create a transnational ecosystem of learning that reflects the subject, connecting students and practitioners from around the world with each other and leading experts.</p>

<p>Participants can register to attend in person at all locations until spots are filled (50 spaces per campus). Limited scholarships are available on a ‘needs basis’ to cover registration, travel, and housing. All food and drink will be provided to attendees.</p>
